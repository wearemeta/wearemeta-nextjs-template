# UI Components

Base UI components that extend or customize the design system.

## Guidelines

- **Prefer design system**: Use components from `@wearemeta/design-system` first
- **Only add custom UI**: Only create components here if they're not available in the design system
- **Reusable**: These should be generic, reusable components

## When to add here

- Custom components not in the design system
- Wrappers around design system components
- App-specific UI patterns
